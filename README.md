## A Simple Shiny App

A link is provided below to run a Shiny web app that presents the experiments known as 
the Michelson–Morley experiment.  The Michelson–Morley experiment was a watershed in 
physics that, essentially, was the first to reveal that the speed of light is not relative.

It's velocity in a vacuum was found to be absolute, and this finding has been reaffirmed  many times since their experiment.  

The Shiny app that you can run presents Michelson–Morley experiment data as a scatter 
point plot and also computes the mean and standard deviation of the data presented. Note that the app gives you the ability of selecting any combination of the five experiments 
Michelson and Morley ran, and the mean and standard deviation is computed for your selections and displayed along with the plot.
