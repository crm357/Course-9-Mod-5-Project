## A Simple Shiny App

A link is provided below to run a Shiny web app that presents the experiments known as 
the Michelson–Morley experiment.  The Michelson–Morley experiment was a watershed in 
physics that, essentially, was the first to reveal that the speed of light is not relative. 
It's velocity in a vacuum was found to be absolute, and this finding has been reaffirmed many 
times since their experiment.  

Michelson and Morley ran five separate experiments.  Each experiment consisted of 20 "runs" where
each run was a separate measurement of light speed.  This produced a total of 100 measurements.

The Shiny app that you can run presents the Michelson–Morley experiment data as a scatter plot and 
also computes the mean and standard deviation of the data presented.  Note that you can select any 
combination of their 5 experiments to see how the data looks and see how the mean and standard 
deviation changes depending on the experiment combination.

A note to you.  This README is intended to meet the documentation requirement for the Developing 
Data Products Course, Module 5 Project assignment.  A careful reading of the project requirements, along with 
the Grading Criteria, reveal ambiguities and contradictions.  This student has exercised certain editorial 
license in my interpretation of the project requirements. Do not be puzzled if you find other students 
having taken a slightly different tack.  

This 10-week Data Science Specialization course sequence is getting long in the tooth and the Hopkins faculty 
might consider a full review of the quizzes and project instructions to bring them up to date.  

You, dear reader, have been forewarned.
